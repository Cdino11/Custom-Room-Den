# Custom-Room-Den
This submod adds a cozy green-walled room where you can relax with Monika. Download [HERE](https://github.com/Cdino11/Custom-Room-Den/releases)


## Hi!, First of all: 
thank you for wanting to use my work! It means a lot that I can do something to make peopleâ€™s 
time with their Monika that much better.

Anyhow, right to the instructions. 

## Simple instructions:

1. Download, unzip, and open the folder called "location selector submod".
2. Inside the 'location selector submod' folder, you'll Copy the 'game' and 'lib' folders into the main 
   'Doki Doki Literature Club' folder (AKA, the folder where you see 'DDLC.exe').
3. Launch MAS, and the room should be available. Monika will explain how to use it after a minute or so.

And that's it! It's that simple.


## All-in-One:

You can alternatively download the all-in-one version attaced below the release, which cantains all of the rooms availible to download (a total of 5 right now)
  and it will be updated when new rooms are available. Thanks to the auto updater(more about it below) by [booplicate](https://github.com/Booplicate) you will be notified in
  game when there is an update and be able to see the description (so you can see wether its an update to the room or an udate to the all-in-one)

## Alternate Downloads:
-[Spaceroom v1](https://github.com/Cdino11/Custom-Room-Furnished-Spaceroom-V1)

-[Spaceroom v2](https://github.com/Cdino11/Custom-Room-Furnished-Spaceroom-V2)

-[Spaceroom v3](https://github.com/Cdino11/Custom-Room-Furnished-Spaceroom-V3)

-[Den](https://github.com/Cdino11/Custom-Room-Den)

-[kitchen](https://github.com/Cdino11/Custom-Room-Kitchen)

## Troubleshooting:

-If the rooms don't show up or if you get an error, most likely the files weren't placed correctly. Repeat 
   step 2, making sure to put the "game" and "lib" folders directly into the main "Doki Doki Literature Club" 
   folder.
-If the problem persists, there may another issue with your install of MAS. Contact me (preferably on Reddit 
   [@tw4449](https://www.reddit.com/user/tw4449) or Discord @ tw4449#3300) and I'll see if I can help.


## Other info:

-At the moment, the extra rooms don't account for the Halloween or Christmas decor (birthday decor works fine, 
   though), but we're planning on fixing this in an update before Halloween.
   
-Luckily, the game will notify you when an update to the submod is available, thanks to submod plugin we 
   incorporated courtesy of [booplicate](https://github.com/Booplicate) (its main repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Booplicate/MAS-Submods-SubmodUpdaterPlugin)). 
   This plugin both notifies you of updates, and helps you download and install them.


## Acknowledgments:

This submod was truly a group effort, with 
[cdino11](https://github.com/cdino11), [multimokia](https://github.com/multimokia), and [d3adpan](https://github.com/d3adpan) handling the coding. It *literally* couldn't have happened without them.


Thanks again for downloading our submod, and I hope you enjoy your time with Monika in your new furnished rooms!
